From Investopedia 'Perception and Cost of NYSE and NASDAQ':

The NYSE and the Nasdaq have different images among companies and investors. Whether a stock trades on the Nasdaq or the NYSE is not necessarily a determining factor for investors. It is, however, for companies that care about how each exchange is perceived.

The Nasdaq is known for technology and innovation, and it is home to digital, biotechnology, and other companies at the cutting edge. As such, stocks listed on the Nasdaq are considered growth-oriented and more volatile. In contrast, companies that list on the NYSE are perceived as more stable and well-established. The NYSE draws blue chips and industrials, some of which have been in business for generations.

However, these perceptions may not be as relevant today as they were in the past. Many corporate giants are listed on the Nasdaq. Think Apple, Google, Microsoft, Meta (formerly Facebook), Amazon, and Intel. Also, the NYSE is trying to appeal to younger or smaller firms with its direct listings (a less-expensive option than an IPO).

Still, the listing requirements for the Nasdaq are more favorable to new companies. The Nasdaq Stock Market has three tiers: Nasdaq Global Select Market, Nasdaq Global Market, and Nasdaq Capital Market...
Given the lower cost of entry, itâ€™s understandable why growth companies with less initial capital might prefer the Nasdaq.
